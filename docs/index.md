## Introduction
---

Hello to you dear reader and welcome to a brief introduction about _myself_; if by some chance you have stumbled upon this as a relic of a long lost civilization, Howdy fella! (that should confuse 'em).

I am your regular ol' Computing Science student, name's Andrei Spiridon (s1027022; _hope these don't work as social security numbers_). As any other 21 year old terrified of what the future holds amid a full-blown pandemic crisis, I tend to drown my worries in endless [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), video games and the likes.

### The truth of the matter

Now some of you may ask yourselves

> What existential dread could possibly push someone to potentially Rick Roll their colleagues and teacher?

Well my friends, this is what you call the old **on-vacation-with-your-girlfriend-and-her-parents** situation, where you just sit in the living room and work on your assignments so that god forbid her father starts another conversation about yesterday's game, and you don't even know what sport he's talking about!
 
### Ending on a high-note

Well, this has been fun, but I have to get to the rest of the assignment. I'll leave you with my favorite movie quote:

>“Do not go gentle into that good night,
>
>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
>
>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
>
>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
>
>Because their words had forked no lightning they
>
>Do not go gentle into that good night.
>
>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.”
